# Generate A Random Person

This is a simple person generator application built using vanilla JavaScript and a third-party API. Primary goal is to use different High Order Array Methods in JS to manipulate data for our own purposes and demonstrate proficiency in doing so. 

## Project Overview
We will leverage https://randomuser.me [A random person generating API].  To quote the documentation, like Lorem Ipsum, but for people. Dynamic person creation and data manipulation with the push of a button. Full disclosure, this was done as part of a class and relied on coaching. While there will be additions over time that cater to my own taste, the fundamental functionality will remain the same. 

## Features
- Fetches real time person (fake) data and represents it in a pleasing way. 
- Supports different functions that manipulate the person data to the user's desires.
- Dynamically updates in real time.
